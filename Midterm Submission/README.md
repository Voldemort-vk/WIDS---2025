Week 1:
In the first week, we were taught about different methods to encode an image. Neural networks came to be very handy for this work. We were taught about the details of neural networks, forward prop., back prop., feature extraction and many more. we were also taught OpenCV for image processing. In the first assignment, we also build an artificail neural networks from scratch to classify the hand written digits in the MNIST dataset. Also we were taught about the CNNs and how they use convolution to extract features from an image and how its better than basic NN in image processing.

Week 2:
In the second week we were taught abbout Natural Language Processing. We were taught many different tools in NLP like tokenization, lemmetization
